		<p>Hey, how's it going? My name is Daniel. I was born and raised in Orlando, Florida, and graduated from the University of Florida in 2016. I am a huge fan of the Orlando Magic and Florida Gators. After college, I moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to work on music videos for artists & brands including Spotify, Future, and T.I.</p>
		<p>Recently settled in Washington, D.C., I am looking for a career-shift into the tech industry in pursuit of my dream goals of creating and learning for a career.</p>
		<p>I am a full stack web developer who thrives on work that is exciting, creative, and liberating. Continuously challenging myself every day brings me passion and inspires me to keep learning.</p>
